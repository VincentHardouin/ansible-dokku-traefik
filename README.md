# Ansible for Traefik & Dokku 

We need to provide some server with some many tools, like frontend + backend, and another apps. 
And we want to serve all service thanks to a reverse-proxy.

For that, I propose this playbook. It install [Dokku](https://dokku.com/), it's small PaaS to deploy some apps like Heroku but it allow to have some other tools like run a docker-compose or anything else. 
 
 
## How it works 


## Why change Dokku default nginx config ? 

Traefik need to listen on port :80 to serve on other intern service. 
And if Dokku use also port 80, Traefik canâ€™t work. 
To resolve that, I decide to change Dokku config to listen in localhost 

## Getting Started 

1. Clone the repo : 

```shell
git clone 
```

2. Install Role : 

```shell
ansible-galaxy install dokku_bot.ansible_dokku
```

```shell
cp vars/sample.app-env.yaml vars/app-env.yaml
```

4. Fill vars : 
- `SSH_KEY_PUB` for your personal ssh key pub `etc/.ssh/_.pub`.
- `SSH_KEY_NAME` name associate to your key, it's create Dokku user with this name. 

3. Run Ansible provision : 

```shell
ansible-playbook playbook.yaml
```

4. Access 

## How to use ? 
If you want use Dokku to deploy your app you simply need to connect to your server with ssh : create app and deploy
